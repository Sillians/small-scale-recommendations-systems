## Building a highly scalable, personalized, customizable collaborative filtering recommendation system with Redis and RedisVL.




### Surprise

[Surprise](https://surpriselib.com/) is a Python scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems that deal with explicit rating data.
The name SurPRISE (roughly :) ) stands for Simple Python RecommendatIon System Engine.

Surprise was designed with the following purposes in mind:

1. Give users perfect control over their experiments. To this end, a strong emphasis is laid on documentation, which we have tried to make as clear and precise as possible by pointing out every detail of the algorithms.
2. Alleviate the pain of Dataset handling. Users can use both built-in datasets (Movielens, Jester), and their own custom datasets.
3. Provide various ready-to-use prediction algorithms such as baseline algorithms, neighborhood methods, matrix factorization-based ( SVD, PMF, SVD++, NMF), and many others. Also, various similarity measures (cosine, MSD, pearson…) are built-in.
4. Make it easy to implement new algorithm ideas.
5. Provide tools to evaluate, analyse and compare the algorithms’ performance. Cross-validation procedures can be run very easily using powerful CV iterators (inspired by scikit-learn excellent tools), as well as exhaustive search over a set of parameters.
