## The `HFTextVectorizer` vectorizer
The HFTextVectorizer class is designed to leverage the power of Hugging Face’s Sentence Transformers for generating text embeddings. This vectorizer is particularly useful in scenarios where advanced natural language processing and understanding are required, and ideal for running on your own hardware (for free).

Utilizing this vectorizer involves specifying a pre-trained model from Hugging Face’s vast collection of Sentence Transformers. These models are trained on a variety of datasets and tasks, ensuring versatility and robust performance across different text embedding needs. Additionally, make sure the sentence-transformers library is installed
